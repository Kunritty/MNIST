# MNIST
This project features a convolutional deep neural network created in Tensorflow's keras API. It was trained to classify the MNIST dataset. Both the convolutional base and dense head are created from scratch. The notebook was  created on Kaggle.com's platform to utilize their free GPU's.

I also created a simple GUI with tkinter to allow the user to draw their own number and see the model's predictions.
